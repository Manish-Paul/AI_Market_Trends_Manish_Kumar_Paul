Problem Statement:
Predicting stock prices is challenging due to the volatile and nonlinear nature of financial markets. Accurate predictions can assist investors, analysts, and businesses in making informed decisions.

Expectation:
Develop a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based model to predict stock closing prices.
Demonstrate model performance with historical data visualization, moving averages, daily returns, and future price predictions

Approach:
Data Collection using yfinance for previous historical data.
Preprocessing: Normalization, sequence generation (60 timesteps).
Model: Two LSTM layers + Dense layers.
Dataset: Historical data for AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN (~250 records each).
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras.
